                There are huge issues around  Refrigeration in these sectors , mainly on sustainability , and we have various solutions.
Refrigeration , by its nature , needs close design attention and we can create solutions for new builds and existing businesses.. 
Working with the Irish Hotel Federation , UK Hospitality , Licensed Vintners Association and Vintners Federation over many years , our LANCER Glycol system ( video attached ) has proven itself to be a game changer .
Along with the Irish and UK Breweries , this system has proven itself to one and all.

We then recover the heat from the Refrigeration to give FREE hot water to the premises.<br><br>

On the hardware side such as Kitchen/Bar/Food Refrigeration , we offer a direct line to our manufacturing partners , thus cutting the middleman out and ensuring  relly good capitla costs for quality equipment.<br><br>
